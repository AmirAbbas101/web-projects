- **JavaScript:**
  - Basics (variables, functions, loops, conditionals, DOM manipulation).
  - ES6+ features (arrow functions, promises, async/await, destructuring).
  - Basic understanding of AJAX and working with JSON.
- **Version Control (Git):**
  - Git basics (commits, branches, pull, push).
  - Collaboration on GitHub.

  - Passing data from views to templates.
- **Templates and Static Files:**
  - Working with the Django template engine.
  - Template inheritance and block content.
  - Loading static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) using `{% static %}`.
- **Models and Database:**
  - Define models in `models.py`.
  - Using Django’s ORM to interact with the database.
  - Basic database operations: `CRUD` (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - Migrating models with `migrate` and `makemigrations`.
  - Using `Django Admin` for model management.
- **Forms:**
  - Working with Django forms (`forms.py`).
  - Model forms and custom forms.
  - Validating and handling form submissions.
  - Integrating front-end form designs.
- **Django Authentication:**
  - Built-in authentication system.
  - User model, login, logout, password reset, password change views.
  - Using the `UserCreationForm` for user registration.
  - Restricting access to views using decorators and middleware.

## 3. Intermediate Django Concepts

- **Working with APIs:**
  - Building REST APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF).
  - Serializers and viewsets in DRF.
  - Authentication in APIs (token-based, session-based).
  - Consuming third-party APIs in Django.
- **Class-Based Views (CBVs):**
  - Introduction to CBVs in Django.
  - Using built-in CBVs (ListView, DetailView, CreateView, etc.).

- **Middleware:**
  - Understand how Django middleware works.
  - Custom middleware creation and usage.
- **File Handling and Media Files:**
  - Managing file uploads in Django.
  - Handling static and media files properly in production.
- **Signals:**
  - Introduction to Django signals.
  - Using signals to trigger actions (e.g., post-save, pre-delete).
- **Caching and Performance Optimization:**
  - Using Django’s caching framework (memcached, Redis).
  - Query optimization using `select_related`, `prefetch_related`.
  - Database indexing for performance improvements.

## 4. Frontend Skills (Frontend Development)

- **JavaScript Framework (React, Vue.js, or Angular):**
  - Learn the basics of a modern JavaScript framework.
  - State management, routing, and interacting with APIs (AJAX, Axios, or Fetch).
  - Setting up a frontend project using Webpack or Vite.
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Learn CSS frameworks like **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS** to create responsive layouts.
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox to manage complex layouts.
- **JavaScript Frontend Framework:**
  - Choose React.js or Vue.js and understand the components, props, and state management.
  - Creating single-page applications (SPAs).
- **Building Dynamic User Interfaces:**
  - Interactivity using JavaScript/React (form validation, dynamic content updates).
  - Fetching data from Django APIs using JavaScript/AJAX.
- **Webpack or Vite.js:**
  - Bundle your frontend assets efficiently using these tools.
- **CSS Preprocessors (SASS/SCSS):**
  - Writing reusable and efficient CSS using SASS or SCSS.

## 5. Full-Stack Development with Django

- **Connecting Frontend with Django:**
  - Django template vs single-page app (SPA) structure.
  - Integrating React/Vue.js or a similar framework with Django.
  - Handling AJAX requests and sending data via Django views and APIs.
- **Django Channels:**
  - Working with Django Channels for WebSockets.
  - Real-time communication (e.g., for chat applications).
- **Third-party Libraries and Plugins:**
  - Using third-party Django packages for additional functionalities (e.g., django-allauth, django-cors-headers, etc.).

## 6. Deployment and Production

- **Deployment of Django Applications:**
  - Using **Gunicorn** or **uWSGI** as a WSGI server.
  - Using **Nginx** as a reverse proxy.
